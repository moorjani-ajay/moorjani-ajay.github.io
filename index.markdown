Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ajay Moorjani, a data engineer and software developer with a decade of experience living in London, UK. I spend my days crafting data pipelines, exploring cloud platforms, and tinkering with open-source tools.

When I'm not immersed in code, you might find me enjoying a good coffee or geeking out over the latest tech trends.

You can learn more about me [here](/about).
